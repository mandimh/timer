Timer -- by Amanda Hamilton

I created this timer to solve a need in my job working with upper elementary students. I needed a timer that would ring every 5 minutes, signaling students to switch to a different job or responsibility. I also needed the timer to restart without requiring any response or input from the user when it rang. 

This timer fills those needs. It signals the time is over by both an audible bell and a color change on the screen.

version 2:

After using the timer for several months, I decided I would like it to have more options. I changed the outside background to gray, and added the option to change the colors of the timer. I have also added the ability to play different bell sounds.
