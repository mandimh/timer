Timer -- by Amanda Hamilton

I created this timer to solve a need in my job working with upper elementary students. I needed a timer that would ring every 5 minutes, signaling students to switch to a different job or responsibility. I also needed the timer to restart without requiring any response or input from the user when it rang. 

This timer fills those needs. It signals the time is over by both an audible bell and a color change on the screen.
